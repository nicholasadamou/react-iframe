## Getting Started

React iFrame is a simple react component that lets you add headers to an iframe. It's super light-weight and requires no external dependencies!

## Usage (Simple)

To use, simply import the component and specify your `src` and `headers`:

const token = localStorage.getItem("token") || new Cookies().get("token");

 headers={{
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  type: "text/html",
 }}
/>;
```
